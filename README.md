# Anomaly-Detection-3-Phase-AC-Motor
This project specifically aims for building a anomaly detection model which determines the anomaly present in the 3-phase AC Motor readings.

## Problem Statement
Data set contains real-time current readings of a 3-phase AC motor (3.2hp) motor current signature analysis and model-based VI analysis to be done to detect anomalies.

Write an ML model to detect anomalies in this data set. The model should learn, and predict future anomalies


## My Approach
Anomaly detection can be done in various ways but here Clustering is used, as we just have to predict the anomalies and segregate it out weather its outlier or not.
The dataset has been changed manually and one outlier value has been updated than other values so that it acts as an anomaly and the algorithm can be detected.


## Technologies Used
- Pandas
